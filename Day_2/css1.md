# <span id="one">Making and linking to our stylesheets</span>

## <span id="">Normalize</span>

All browsers have default CSS styling. You may have noticed that our image has a white border around it.

![Not what we want](../img/day_1/normalize-border.png)

This isn't really what we want; for a nice, sharp layout, we want our image sitting flush with the edge of the browser window. To achieve this, we need to remove the default CSS styling in the browser so that we can get a 'clean slate' state for our custom CSS to build on. Enter Normalize.

> Head to [https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) to download Normalize. Select all of the code in the window and copy it.

We need to put the Normalize styling in a CSS file. Open `Terminal` and, in the root of your project folder, type the following:

```
mkdir css
touch css/normalize.css
```

Then in your IDE, paste the contents of your clipboard into `normalize.css` and save.
