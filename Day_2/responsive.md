# <span id="one">Why be responsive?</span>

It used to be the case that, not matter how you wanted to style your page, you didn't have to worry too much about the user experience differing between users. Browser formatting variations aside, most people saw roughly the same site because there was only one device you could view the internet on; a computer monitor.

But these days we live in the 'Internet of Things'; an ever-growing selection of vastly different types of devices are hooked up to the web at all times. This means plenty of different screens; not only desktop monitors, but also laptop screens, notebooks, and tablets and smartphones of all different shapes and sizes.

Responsive design means that no matter the size or shape of the screen being used to display content, that content can be reliably viewed and interacted with. Responsive design is now a web standard; it's not optional. Failing to build your front end with responsiveness in mind can not only make your site unattractive for your users - it can make it outright unusable.

When we made our website's header yesterday, we used `display: inline` to make a single horizontal menu which looks great on a desktop. But now we have a problem; mobile screens don't have the width to display the menu links like this. If you try to view your site in a smaller screen using the Dev Tools, you'll see that it behaves oddly.
