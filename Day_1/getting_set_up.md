# Getting Set Up

### Join the Slack channel

We have our own Slack channel for the Bootcamp, where we can chat about code, our projects, and work through problems together. If you have any questions or confusions during the week, use the channel to chat about it with your fellow students. Your mentors will also be on the channel to help out.

# 1. Terminal

If you're on a Mac, you'll already have a program called `Terminal` installed. Press `CMD + Space` and type 'terminal' in the bar to find it. Alternatively you can find it in you Applications folder. Once you've found it, drag it onto your dock so it's at hand. Those using Linux systems will also already have the Terminal program.

Windows users will get a terminal alongside their Git download. When you need to open `Terminal` during the Bootcamp, you'll need to open `Git Bash`. Drag the program `Bash` onto your toolbar, or make a shortcut on your Desktop.


# 2. Install Git

> [https://git-scm.com/download/](https://git-scm.com/download/)

Git is an open-source versional control system. It makes working on projects, both solo but especially as part of a group, much more efficient. Head to the link above and install the right version of Git for your operating system.


# 3. Make a GitHub account

Next, we need to make an account of GitHub so that the code we write can be stored on the internet.

# 4. Install an IDE

'IDE' stands for 'Integrated Development Environment'. An IDE is basically a program designed specifically for developers to use in the writing of code. For this bootcamp, we'll be using Sublime Text 3. Sublime is a very widely-use IDE with excellent community support. If you've used Microsoft Word before, you shouldn't find it difficult to use. But as we go along, you'll see that Sublime offers a lot of useful features for coders.

# 5. Install Google Chrome

Your experience with web development will differ according to which browser you're working with. We'll be working with Google Chrome this week, because Chrome has a fantastic range of developer-specific tools which we'll be working with a lot.
