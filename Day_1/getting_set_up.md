# Getting Set Up

### Join the Slack channel

We have our own Slack channel for the Bootcamp, where we can chat about code, our projects, and work through problems together. If you have any questions or confusions during the week, use the channel to chat about it with your fellow students. Your mentors will also be on the channel to help out.

# 1. Terminal

If you're on a Mac, you'll already have a program called `Terminal` installed. Press `CMD + Space` and type 'terminal' in the bar to find it. Alternatively you can find it in you Applications folder. Once you've found it, drag it onto your dock so it's at hand. Those using Linux systems will also already have the Terminal program.

Windows users will get a terminal alongside their Git download. When you need to open `Terminal` during the Bootcamp, you'll need to open `Git Bash`. Drag the program `Bash` onto your toolbar, or make a shortcut on your Desktop.


# 2. Install Git

> [https://git-scm.com/download/](https://git-scm.com/download/)

Git is an open-source versional control system. It makes working on projects, both solo but especially as part of a group, much more efficient. Head to the link above and install the right version of Git for your operating system.


# 3. Make a GitHub account

Next, we need to make an account of GitHub so that the code we write can be stored on the internet.

# 4. Install an IDE

'IDE' stands for 'Integrated Development Environment'. An IDE is basically a program designed specifically for developers to use in the writing of code. For this bootcamp, we'll be using Sublime Text 3. Sublime is a very widely-use IDE with excellent community support. If you've used Microsoft Word before, you shouldn't find it difficult to use. But as we go along, you'll see that Sublime offers a lot of useful features for coders.

**Note:** If you have a preferred IDE that you're comfortable which isn't Sublime Text (eg, Atom), then please feel free to use that instead.

### Some extra packages for Sublime

There are a few extra bits we can install to make our time using Sublime Text a bit easier. With Sublime open, press `CMD + Shift + P` (`CTRL + Shift + P` on PC). Select 'Package control : Install Package' and enter 'SideBarEnhancements'. Select it to install. This will allow us to open our files in Chrome directly from Sublime.


# 5. Install Google Chrome

Your experience with web development will differ according to which browser you're working with. We'll be working with Google Chrome this week, because Chrome has a fantastic range of developer-specific tools which we'll be working with a lot.

# 6. Install Node.js

It's simplest to say that Node is JavaScript on the back end, but it's a bit more complex than that. We're installing Node here for acces to `npm`, Node Package Manager. `npm` will allow us to easily install convenient pre-written code packages that will make our app more dynamic.

# 7. Install Ruby

**Note: If you're on a Mac, you can skip this step.**

Ruby is a back-end programming language. We won't be using it this week, but we need it in order to enable the use of Sass, which will allow us to work with more advanced CSS.

# 8. Install Sass

Sass is a _CSS precompiler_. It allows developers to write more complex CSS, which we'll be doing in the middle of the week.
