# Let's get coding

You've got all of your developer tools set up, and you're ready to start coding. As a front end developer, typically the first place you'll begin is with the 'bare bones' of your project; the HTML page structure.

# <span id="one">1. Making the 'skeleton' of our project</span>

Open `terminal` and navigate to where you'd like your project to be stored. The Desktop is a good place to keep it. 

type `touch index.html` in the root directory of your project. Remember; if you're not sure where you are currently in the terminal, you can type `pwd` for the address.

# <span id="two">2. Good HTML layout</span>

HTML files are typically laid out as such:

```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
    <head>
      // content in the head goes here. This usually involves things like CSS / JavaScript links,
      // the title of the page, etc.
    </head>
    <body>
      // Body content goes here.
    </body>
  </html>
```

# <span id="three">3. All about linking</span>

# <span id="four">4. Using comments</span>

# <span id="five">5. Some common HTML elements</span>

- 'semantic' elements; eg, headers.
