# JavaScript

You may recall from day 1 in our discussion on what the front end is, that JavaScript is the primary front-end language for determining the behaviour of a website.

We're going to be moving on to working with JavaScript now. Don't panic if it seems harder than HTML and CSS; that's because it is! But just like anything, it will all come together with practice.

Back on Day 1, we installed `node`, and it's this that will allow us to run our JavaScript files in the `Terminal` and see the output.

From within the containing folder of a JS files, simply type:

```
node [FILE_NAME].js
```

To run the code in Node.
