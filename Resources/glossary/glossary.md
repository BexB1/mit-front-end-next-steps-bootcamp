### CSS
  CSS stands for 'Cascading Stylesheets'. CSS is the primary way of _styling_ webpages; after you've arranged the base structure of the page in HTML, CSS allows you to really make it shine. In earlier versions, CSS was mostly limited to the purely aesthetic - you could use it to colour elements and change their size and position, but not much else. But today's CSS, CSS3, is an entirely different beast - new additions to the language mean that you can use CSS not only to style, but to animate and design websites with greater complexity.
