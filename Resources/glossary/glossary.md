### Angular

AngularJS is a structural framework for dynamic web apps. It lets you use HTML as your template language and lets you extend HTML's syntax to express your application's components clearly and succinctly.

### CSS
  CSS stands for 'Cascading Stylesheets'. CSS is the primary way of _styling_ webpages; after you've arranged the base structure of the page in HTML, CSS allows you to really make it shine. In earlier versions, CSS was mostly limited to the purely aesthetic - you could use it to colour elements and change their size and position, but not much else. But today's CSS, CSS3, is an entirely different beast - new additions to the language mean that you can use CSS not only to style, but to animate and design websites with greater complexity.

### ECMAScript

ECMAScript is simply the latest official standard of JavaScript.

### ES6

The last major version or 'standard' of JavaScript. It was released in 2015 (hence it sometimes being called 'ES2015'), and brought many huge changes to the language.

### Git
  A form of `version control`. Git allows for the easy management of either personal or large-scale projects.

### GitHub

  A website and space in the cloud for the storage of the many, many repositories (or, 'repos') made by developers using Git.

### HTML
  HTML stands for 'Hypertext Markup Language', and it was the original language of the web. You can think of HTML as the 'bones' of the web; all front end development is based off of it.

### HTTP

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application protocol for distributed, collaborative, and hypermedia information systems. HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web. Hypertext is structured text that uses logical links (hyperlinks) between nodes containing text.

### HTTPS

Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is the secure version of HTTP, the protocol over which data is sent between your browser and the website that you are connected to. The 'S' at the end of HTTPS stands for 'Secure'. It means all communications between your browser and the website are encrypted.

### IDE

An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of a source code editor, build automation tools and a debugger.

### JavaScript

From [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript):

> JavaScript is a programming language that allows you to implement complex things on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, or interactive maps, or animated 2D/3D graphics, or scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.

### jQuery

jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers.

### Node

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment for executing JavaScript code server-side. 

### NPM

npm , short for Node Package Manager, is two things: first and foremost, it is an online repository for the publishing of open-source Node.js projects; second, it is a command-line utility for interacting with said repository that aids in package installation, version management, and dependency management.

### React

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
