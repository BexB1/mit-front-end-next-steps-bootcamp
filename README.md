# Hello and welcome to Mum's in Tech's _'Next Steps in Front End Development'_ Bootcamp


## What to expect from this bootcamp

In this course, you’ll learn basic-to-intermediate front end development skills. You’ll learn to build webpages in HTML, style and animate them in CSS, bring them to life with JavaScript, and work with coding tools used by professional developers. Whether you’re brand new to coding or already have some skills, you’ll walk away from this course having made your very own project to be proud of.

We'll be coding a project together throughout the week during our lessons, but you absolutely don't have to build what we're building. If you'd rather tweak the site we make to your own liking, or even just apply what we learn together to a project that is entirely your own, that's perectly okay.
 
## Two little things...

  1. I promise that if I have a question, I will ask it and not hold on to it for fear of sounding silly. 
  **There are no stupid questions.**
  2. **I will remember that my fellow students can be my most valuable learning resource.**
    Bex and Marisa will be available all through the week to help you out if you're struggling. But don't underestimate how important your classmates are in your learning! Share tips and tricks that you discover with each other, and ask each other questions. You might be surprised how quickly you can solve things together.
